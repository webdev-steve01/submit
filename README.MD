## About project

This project is my (Sylvester-paul Osesojeh Stephen) submission for the first task of the Netwalkers NG internship Onboarding session. It was made to resemble the figma design as much as possible.

## Issues faced

I noticed the absence of a mobile design, I have grown accustomed to mobile first design so the project is built specifically for desktop screens.

## conclusion

I would like to extend my appreciation to Netwalkers NG for this wonderful opportunity to show my worth as a front end developer, I hope my submission qualifies me for the internship position.
